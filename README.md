**3D Registration in 30 Years: A Survey**
## 1 Introduction
3D point clouds to a unified coordinate system, known as 3D point cloud registration, is a fundamental problem in numerous areas such as computer vision, computer graphics, robotics, and remote sensing.
## 2 Pairwise Registration}
### 2.1 Introduction

### 2.2 Pairwise Coarse Registration

#### 2.2.1 Geometric methods
In correspondence-based methods, a crucial step is the generation of correspondences, which plays a key role in determining the accuracy and robustness of the registration process.
